# Business Application Developer

As a Business Application Developer, you will be joining our team to build tailored business applications with Elixir and the Phoenix web framework. Developing software with us will include:

- exploring features through methods such as Story Mapping and Event-storming
- incrementally building features in a test-driven manner
- architecting and discussing applications using a Domain-Driven Design mindset
- pair-programming with a team member frequently

We offer an environment that makes software development sustainable and enjoyable through a simplified business model.

- We bill by the block (4-days), so you can focus on building great software rather than tracking hours.
- Working in blocks avoids the overhead of context switching and the feeling of being stretched in multiple directions.
- With only four billable days, you have a day each week to invest in your professional development and making the company work better.

## Requirements

We are looking for a software developer local to Montreal who has experience with:

- the Erlang VM
- developing web-based applications
- acceptance and unit testing

The items below would be great as well. If you don't check any of these boxes it's not a huge deal, but we would expect these to be part of your professional development:

- a good understanding of Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), along with specific knowledge of PostgreSQL
- practical experience with Domain-Driven Design
- software modeling using Story Mapping, Event-storming or some other data modeling technique
