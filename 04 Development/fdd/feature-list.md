# Build a Feature List

| Type                           | Template                       | Example                       |
| ---                            | ---                            | ---                           |
| Major Feature Sets (aka Areas) | `<object> management`          | Car Service Management        |
| Feature Sets (aka Activities)  | `<action><-ing> a(n) <object>` | Scheduling a Service          |
| Feature (aka Tasks)            | `<action><result><object>`     | Schedule a service for a car  |

* Features are granular (max. less than 3-days, most take less)
* Full feature template: `<action> the <result> <by|for|of|to> a(n) <object>`
