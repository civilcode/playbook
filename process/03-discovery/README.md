# Discovery

A week long process to scope a project before developing a plan and recommending a budget.

Effort: 1-2 developer blocks (it's probably more than this but we want to keep it affordable).

- Gather and review any related documents and review
  - manuals
  - forms
  - existing apps
- Prepare discovery session
- Conduct discovery session
- Review discovery session
- Develop plan and estimate budget

## How we estimate

For the back-end development, we come up with a list features (module/abilities/tasks) and assign a weight to each task (small, medium, large, x-large) and we then assign a number of blocks per weight. We then have a total of blocks per module.

We then add a 25% for the user interface. That pourcentage depends on the kind of application and the discussions that happened during the discovery session.

We add around 5 blocks for setting up the IT infrastructure.

Finally, we add around 15% for project management.
