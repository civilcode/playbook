# Qualification

Typically qualification happens with a first phone call to determine if we should meet in person. We qualify the opportunity based on the following criteria:

- Can we use open source tools? (Rails/Elixir/Postgres)
- Is the project apporpriate for web-based solution?
- Will they commit and pay for a discovery session?
- Are they comfortable with a fixed price/flexible features or fixed features/flexible price engagement?
- Are they prepared to work in an iterative/incremental manner?
- Can the application be hosted externally or are the capable of hosting?

## Other important questions

- how did you find out about us?
- what you looking from us? 
- what resources do you require?
- why are you not handling this internally?
- who is the audience for the application?
- what is the goal of the application?
- do you have a budget?
- when do you hope to start the project?
- is there a specific deadline?
- how are you going to decide on your development partner?
- are there any constraints related to technology or process that we should be aware of?
- can you please provide some background on the project?

# Onboarding

## Summary

- why
- risks of software development
- application (website) lifecycle (what)
- facets
- development process (how)
- team (who)
- tools

## Why

- software development is inherently risky

- problems
  - communications issues
    - e.g. terminology; e.g difference staging and production
  - unclear responsibilities
    - e.g. "I thought you were going to create the content of the site"
    - e.g. "I didn't know that I was going to spend so much time giving you feedback"
  - lack of awareness
    - e.g. difficult for the client to plan
  - inefficient relationship
    - e.g. too much in progress

- goals
  - work as one team
  - establishing shared vocabulary
  - set expectations
    - Process
    - deliverables
    - communicate protocols
    - responsibilities
