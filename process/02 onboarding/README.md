# Onboarding

**Draft**: Below is a list of notes from a brainstorming session. These need to be crafted
into documentation.

## Resources

- Master Services Agreement
- Statement of Work
- Letter of Engagement

## Summary

- why
- risks of software development
- application (website) lifecycle (what)
- facets
- development process (how)
- team (who)
- tools

## Why

- software development is inherently risky

- problems
  - communications issues
    - e.g. terminology; e.g difference staging and production
  - unclear responsibilities
    - e.g. "I thought you were going to create the content of the site"
    - e.g. "I didn't know that I was going to spend so much time giving you feedback"
  - lack of awareness
    - e.g. difficult for the client to plan
  - inefficient relationship
    - e.g. too much in progress

- goals
  - work as one team
  - establishing shared vocabulary
  - set expectations
    - Process
    - deliverables
    - communicate protocols
    - responsibilities
