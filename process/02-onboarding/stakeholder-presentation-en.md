# Agenda

- The nature of software development
- Risks in developing software
- Practices we embrace

---

# History

- In the past, software development teams were using the Waterfall methodology
- In the 90s, Agile movement introduced lightweight methodologies

# Waterfall methodology is wrong

- Suited for well-planned processes (i.e. manufacturing)
- Not suited for empirical process (i.e. new product development)

---

> The empirical model of process control provides and exercises control through
frequent inspection and adaptation for processes that are imperfectly defined
and generate unpredictable and unrepeatable outputs.
-- Wikipedia

---

> Software creation is an empirical activity

# Effects on Software Creation

- Cannot define a 100% accurate specification upfront
- Cannot reliably estimate effort and cost
- Impossible to accurately schedule
- Requires creative adaptation

# Risks in software development

- Going over budget
- Late delivery
- Not meeting requirements/expectations
  - features, performance, reliability, durability

---

# Practices we embrace

- Dedicated Product Owner
- Iterative approach
- Feedback early and often
- Executable specifications
- Open source

---

# Minimum Viable Product

- Value is delivered at each stage of development
- Solution is delivered and improved upon in an iterative model
- At each stage, the solution can be evaluated and adjusted if needed

# Example

- Client database in read-only, updates through Excel
- Portfolios in read-only, updates through Excel
- Client updates in new system
- Portfolios updates in new system

# Other practices we embrace

Ubiquitous Language • Continuous Investment • Peer Reviews • Pair Programming • Event Storming • Domain Modeling • Discovery • Story Mapping • Specification by Examples
