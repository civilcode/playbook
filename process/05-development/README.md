# Development

## How we work

Before contributing to development there are a number of concepts you need to understand:

1. How we model the domain
2. How we develop features
3. How we automate acceptance tests

## 1. How we model the domain

See the [Object Modeling Trail](../../education/trails/object-modeling.md).

## 2. How we develop features

We develop the application feature by feature using the [Feature-Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature-driven_development) process. This means:

1. We start with _Developing an Overall [Object Model](../../education/trails/object-modeling.md)_
2. We [Build a Feature Roadmap](./fdd/feature-list.md) (module, feature-set, feature) based on the Object Model
3. We _Plan Feature Development_ based on the Roadmap
4. We [Design by Feature](./fdd/feature.md#design)
5. We [Build by Feature](./fdd/feature.md#build)

### Develop by Feature using GitHub

Use the following templates when working with GitHub Issues:

- Design the [feature-module and feature-set](./fdd/feature-module-set.md)
- Design and build the [feature](./fdd/feature.md)

## 3. How we automate acceptance tests

See the [Specification By Example Trail](../../education/trails/specification-by-example.md).
