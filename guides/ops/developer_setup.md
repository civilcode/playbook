# Developer Setup Guide

Before installation ensure all issues have been resolved in the following repos:

* [laptop](https://github.com/civilcode/laptop)
* [dotfiles](https://github.com/civilcode/dotfiles)

Assuming you are on the local version of Mac OS:

1. Run the laptop script: [https://github.com/civilcode/laptop](https://github.com/civilcode/laptop)
2. Install dotfiles: [https://github.com/civilcode/dotfiles](https://github.com/civilcode/dotfiles)
3. Install Docker: [https://www.docker.com/docker-mac](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac)

## Highlights

* ['homebrew cask'](https://caskroom.github.io) is used for mac installation
* ['asdf'](https://github.com/asdf-vm) is used to manage Elixir versions
