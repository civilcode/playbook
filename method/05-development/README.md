# Development

## How we work

Before contributing to development there are a number of concepts you need to understand:

1. How we model the domain
2. How we develop features
3. How we automate acceptance tests

## 1. How we model the domain

See the [Object Modeling Trail](../../education/trails/object-modeling.md).

## 2. How we develop features

We develop the application feature by feature using the [Feature-Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature-driven_development) process. This means:

1. We start with [_Developing an Overall Object Model_](develop-object-model.md)\_\_
2. We [_Build a Feature Roadmap_](feature-list.md) \(module, feature-set, feature\) based on the Object Model
3. We _Plan Feature Development_ based on the Roadmap
4. We _Design by Feature_
5. We _Build by Feature_

For building features please review the [reference application and guides](https://github.com/civilcode/magasin).

### 3. How we automate acceptance tests

To be developed.
