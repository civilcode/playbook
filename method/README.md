# CivilCode Method

The CivilCode Method is a description of our _way-of-working_. The method is a set of practices and tools used by our team to guide and support our work. "A _practice_ is a repeatable approach to doing something with a specific objective in mind."[^1]

The terminology used to describe our _method_ is based on the [Essence Kernel and Language](http://semat.org/documents/20181/57862/formal-18-10-02.pdf/866c80c0-cdc8-488b-bcf8-0c67cb60b5d7) from the SEMAT (Software Engineering Method and Theory) initiative.
