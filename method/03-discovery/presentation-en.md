## Define Minimum Viable Product \(MVP\)

## Definition

> A minimum viable product has just those core features that allow the product to be deployed, and no more. The product is typically deployed to a subset of possible customers, such as early adopters that are thought to be more forgiving, more likely to give feedback, and able to grasp a product vision from an early prototype or marketing information. -- Wikipedia

^ "highest return on investment versus risk"

## Define Minimum Viable Product \(MVP\)

Activity

* select target actors
* select target goals
* select target tasks from timeline
* consider: good, better, best

\[example\]

## Next Steps
