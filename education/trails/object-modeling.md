## The Basics

### Archetypes

* the event archetype (aka Moment-Interval); red
  * a moment of time or an interval of time
  * one needs to work with or track for business or legal reasons
  * examples are sale, rental
* the role archetype; yellow  
  * way of participation by a PPT
  * examples are owner, customer
* the "catalog-entry like description" archetype; blue
  * a collection of values that apply again and again
  * example "vehicle" with a serial number (thing) vs. "vehicle description" with a model number (description)
* the "party, place or thing" archetype (PPT); green
  * someone or something that plays a role
  * examples are organization, location, product
