# Elixir Lang

## Getting started

- Get motivated: [Keynote: Think Different by Dave Thomas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hDVftaPQwY)
- Learn the basics: [Elixir Guides](http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html)
- Read the book: [Programming Elixir](https://pragprog.com/book/elixir/programming-elixir)

## Beyond the basics

- [Elixir in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action) (highly recommended)
- [Elixir Sips](http://elixirsips.com/)
- See [Elixir Lang website for more resources](http://elixir-lang.org/learning.html)

## Start with focusing on Elixir's conventional programming concepts:

- pattern matching
- non-scalar data types
- strings

## Learning about Strings

The string implementation in Elixir is more powerful in other languages, but that comes with more of a learning curve.
