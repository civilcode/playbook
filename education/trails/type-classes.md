# Type Classes

Although Elixir is not a strongly typed language, we do think in terms of Types. We lean on
Dialyzer to enforce contracts and to enforce types for inputs and outputs. Our thinking on Types
are heavily influenced by ML style functional programming languages.

Type Classes enable Domain-Driven Design.
