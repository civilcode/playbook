## Advanced

* [Patterns for Building Distributed Systems for The Enterprise](http://app.pluralsight.com/courses/cqrs-theory-practice): this course provides some great insight to when to use CQRS. The differentiation between Event Sourcing and Event Streaming is of particular note which doesn't get much attention.
* [Further Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/): the unpublished follow-up to [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](https://www.martinfowler.com/books/eaa.html) provides great definitions, descriptions and example of patterns such as [Event Sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) and [Event Collaboration](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventCollaboration.html).
