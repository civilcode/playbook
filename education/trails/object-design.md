# Object Design

### Design principles

* Commands down the stack, notifications up the stack

### Where to put a method?

 Take a feature statement and put the initiating method in the corresponding class.

`<action> the <result> <by|for|of|to> a <moment-interval|role|description|part, place, thing>`

Example: `calculate the anticipated total of an RFQ.`

We put the initiating method in the RFQ class.
